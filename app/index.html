          <h3>Episode IV</h3>
          <h1>A NEW HOPE</h1>
          <p>
            It is a period of civil war.
            Rebel spaceships, striking
            from a hidden base, have won
            their first victory against
            the evil Galactic Empire.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the battle, Rebel
            spies managed to steal secret
            plans to the Empire's
            ultimate weapon, the DEATH
            STAR, an armored space
            station with enough power to
            destroy an entire planet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pursued by the Empire's
            sinister agents, Princess
            Leia races home aboard her
            starship, custodian of the
            stolen plan that can save
            her people and restore
            freedom to the galaxy....
